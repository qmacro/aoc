# Advent of Code - Some Clojure Solutions

I am using the excellent [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)
to help me learn more about Clojure. This repo is an attempt to 
assemble my musings and solutions (what I have so far) into some
sort of order. 

Warning : I am a Clojure beginner, and therefore my code is almost 
certainly not ideal, performant (although that wasn't a primary goal),
or even idiomatic. But I'm giving it a good go, and trying to come up
with solutions using only immutable data structures.
